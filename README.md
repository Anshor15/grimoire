```
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -Subject "CN=PBS Software, O=dargoz, C=ID" -KeyUsage DigitalSignature -FriendlyName "MB Back Office" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3", "2.5.29.19={text}")
```
You can view your certificate in a PowerShell window by using the following commands:
```
Set-Location Cert:\CurrentUser\My
Get-ChildItem | Format-Table Subject, FriendlyName, Thumbprint
```
Above command will print :
```
Thumbprint                   Subject
----------                   -------
<YOUR Thumbprint>            CN=PBS Software, O=dargoz, C=ID
```
then you can use that information to
export cert :
```cmd
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String <YOUR PASSWORD> -Force -AsPlainText
Export-PfxCertificate -cert "Cert:\CurrentUser\My\<YOUR Thumbprint>" -FilePath "C:\dev\certs\grimoire.pfx" -Password $password
```
